You may or may not know it by now, but Pinterest recently launched a seemingly long-awaited messaging feature .  “Long-awaited” in the regard that this comes almost a year after the release of their  “send a pin” ‘feature. Soon after, Pinterest realized that users did not have many options after receiving a pin – they could either repin, like, or comment on it, and then take the conversation offline afterwards.  The users weren’t enabled to stay engaged on Pinterest.


The idea behind the messaging feature is to allows users to have dynamic and meaningful conversations on pins they share with others. Some quick use cases:

* You just moved into a new apartment with a roommate/special other and you are looking for interior design inspiration. Messaging allows you to share pins you like as well as give feedback on the fly of what’s being shared with you.
* You and said roommate/special other are having a house warming party for newly decorated apartment, but have no idea what sort of food to prepare for your guests. Pulled pork anyone?

The list goes on and on.

From a Product perspective, Pinterest gains quite a few substantial benefits.  By having this messaging feature, Pinterest enables users to stay engaged on their platform (as opposed to moving offline). Increased time on site = increased number of pins = more engaged users.

Ultimately, Pinterest’s business model comes down to users discovering the things they want. If they can develop methods to keep a user engaged longer – by allowing the ability to have conversations over their discoveries with others on their platform – they effectively increase the potency of their business model.

You can ask yourself a variety questions when trying to understand user engagement for your own products:

* How can you enable your users to remain engaged with your product and stay aligned with the product’s vision?
What constitutes a successful resolution or fulllilment of a user’s problem/need? What key activities are directly linked to this resolution?
* What are the engagement patterns of the various user types (e.g., registered customers, upgraded customers, free-trial, etc)?
* How can you turn your users into your number one product advocates? Provide a medium for your users to engage and draw non-users into your community – not only is there a cost-saving component, but this also drives credibility.
