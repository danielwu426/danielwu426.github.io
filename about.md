Hi, I'm Dan. I'm an aspiring product manager interested in design, user experience, and emerging technologies. I'm currently helping shape the world of next-gen commerce as an Associate Product Manager at [Braintree](http://www.braintreepayments.com).

Prior to Braintree, I spent a few years at PricewaterhouseCoopers in a tech consulting role gaining software implementation, business analysis, and project management experience.

In addition to what I've already told you I enjoy travel, attending concerts, Chicago summers, and University of Iowa athletics.

Thanks for reading!
